# Train Controller Database

This is the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) source for the [Train Controller Database](https://traincontrollerdb.marcriera.cat), a website with documentation about train controllers and compatible software.

The main working repository is https://git.marcriera.cat/marc/train-controller-db. Until federation is fully implemented in Forgejo, you can open issues and pull requests on [the repository's copy on GitHub](https://github.com/marcriera/train-controller-db).
