## Technical details

The controller follows the standard [internal operation](/hardware/tech/console-controllers) of console controllers.

To allow PlayStation software to distinguish the controller from a standard controller, **UP** and **DOWN** on the D-pad are pressed permanently. This combination is impossible on an unmodified digital gamepad or Dualshock.
