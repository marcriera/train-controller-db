### Welcome to the Train Controller Database!

Here you will find a collection of practical information and technical details for various train controllers and compatible software. The information has been gathered from my actual experience and the references mentioned on this site.

If you find this site useful, share it with other people who may like it.

Enjoy!

### Contributing

This is a personal project developed in my free time. If you find incorrect or missing data, want to include software or hardware not currently documented or have any suggestion, your contribution is very welcome! You can either:

- Open an issue or pull request on [the repository's copy on GitHub](https://github.com/marcriera/train-controller-db) (until federation is fully implemented in Forgejo, this is the only way to get external contributions directly).
- Send me a message on the Fediverse: [@marc@marcriera.cat](https://micro.marcriera.cat/@marc)
